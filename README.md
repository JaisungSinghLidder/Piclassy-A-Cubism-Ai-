# Piclassy-A-Cubism-Ai-
This is an evolutionary algorithm that tries to recreate images in the Cubist style.
Here's a quick summary of the code:
1)Cubism_Gene_Revised - This defines each of the gene and each of its trait.
2)Fitness_Cubism - This defines the fitness function of the evolutionary algoirthm.
3)Mutation_Cubism - This will mutate the genes to try to create more fit candidates.
4)Selection_Cubism - This will have a tournament selection to get fit individuals.
