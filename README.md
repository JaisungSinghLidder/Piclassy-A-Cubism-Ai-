# Piclassy - A Cubism AI

This is an evolutionary algorithm that tries to recreate images in the Cubist style.

---

## 📁 Project Summary

Here's a quick summary of the code components:

- **Cubism_Gene_Revised**  
  Defines each gene and its traits.

- **Fitness_Cubism**  
  Defines the fitness function of the evolutionary algorithm.

- **Mutation_Cubism**  
  Mutates the genes to try to create more fit candidates.

- **Selection_Cubism**  
  Uses tournament selection to get fit individuals.

**Important Note:**
I used OpenCV for Computer Vision and had to use CMake so that it could work.
